This Jupyter notebook explores the impact of dropout on the generalization of a feedforward neural network for the IMDB movie review sentiment classification task. 
The model is trained both with and without dropout, using pretrained word embeddings for input representation. 
Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. While dropout offers some improvement, the difference in results is modest.
